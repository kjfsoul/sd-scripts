## Notes
This improved prompt removes redundancies and organizes the terms in a more coherent way. The "sots art" term was removed as it's unclear what it refers to. The "painting man" was likely a formatting error. The expanded prompt adds some additional descriptive terms that might enhance the cohesiveness of your deck.
